# 100daysOfCode
taking on the 100 days of code challenge

<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>Today was the first day I decided to take on the 100 days of code and I am a little confused to be honest. I followed a step by step guide from MDN web docs on a number guessing game. I don't really feel like I created it myself, I feel like a fraud who just copy and posted whatever they said to copy and paste. Here is the link if you're interested. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash</p>
