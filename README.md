# 100daysOfCode
taking on the 100 days of code challenge

<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>Today was the first day I decided to take on the 100 days of code and I am a little confused to be honest. I followed a step by step guide from MDN web docs on a number guessing game. I don't really feel like I created it myself, I feel like a fraud who just copy and posted whatever they said to copy and paste. Here is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash">link</a> if you're interested. </p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>I think some key takeaways for today is that I need to look for a different approach, or maybe take this approach and run with it. I feel fradulent almost writing the code and putting it up, but I need to remember that it's okay. I need to follow these tutorials and also take notes, keep track of what I am learning. I kind of skipped around and just copy and pasted becuase I was getting angry with myself for not being able to just do the code instead of reading the why's and how's of the documentation.</p>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>Second day of 100 days and I was feeling a bit eh. I got stuck with the feeling of being some sort of imposter yesterday and stuck with not knowing how to go about this challenge. I tried looking at what other people did and I couldn't find anything that remotely answered my question. So I tried just jumping right into a coding challenge and boy was I lost. I realized I don't read code too well. Not that I don't know what's going on, but that I really don't read what's going on. I couldn't find out why the page was too big in the sense that I needed to scroll. I knew something wasn't right, but looking real closely I saw, that I had put 'height: 100vw'. If you're lost just like I was, the 'vw' stands for viewport width and if you had a lightbulb moment like I did, that's height, not width. I changed the w into an h and it worked perfectly. That little mistake took me about 20 minutes to find...yea. I am still a little confused on how to keep going with this challenge, but I think I need to hit the basics again, maybe just as a refresher with HTML and CSS and slowly make my way back into JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>The takeaway for today is to maybe do some HTML and CSS as a refresher. Go back and create some simple HTML only sites and then incorporate some CSS into them as well. I need to go back and refresh myself on the basics of HTML and CSS and work my way back into JavaScript just so I can get the hang of it again. Also, take this time to plan out what projects I want to work on since I am sort of just looking around and doing random stuff.</p>
