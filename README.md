# 100daysOfCode
taking on the 100 days of code challenge

<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>Today was the first day I decided to take on the 100 days of code and I am a little confused to be honest. I followed a step by step guide from MDN web docs on a number guessing game. I don't really feel like I created it myself, I feel like a fraud who just copy and posted whatever they said to copy and paste. Here is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash">link</a> if you're interested. </p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>I think some key takeaways for today is that I need to look for a different approach, or maybe take this approach and run with it. I feel fradulent almost writing the code and putting it up, but I need to remember that it's okay. I need to follow these tutorials and also take notes, keep track of what I am learning. I kind of skipped around and just copy and pasted becuase I was getting angry with myself for not being able to just do the code instead of reading the why's and how's of the documentation.</p>

<h1>Day 2</h1>
<p>Second day of 100 days and I was feeling a bit eh. I got stuck with the feeling of being some sort of imposter yesterday and stuck with not knowing how to go about this challenge. I tried looking at what other people did and I couldn't find anything that remotely answered my question. So I tried just jumping right into a coding challenge and boy was I lost. I realized I don't read code too well. Not that I don't know what's going on, but that I really don't read what's going on. I couldn't find out why the page was too big in the sense that I needed to scroll. I knew something wasn't right, but looking real closely I saw, that I had put 'height: 100vw'. If you're lost just like I was, the 'vw' stands for viewport width and if you had a lightbulb moment like I did, that's height, not width. I changed the w into an h and it worked perfectly. That little mistake took me about 20 minutes to find...yea. I am still a little confused on how to keep going with this challenge, but I think I need to hit the basics again, maybe just as a refresher with HTML and CSS and slowly make my way back into JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>The takeaway for today is to maybe do some HTML and CSS as a refresher. Go back and create some simple HTML only sites and then incorporate some CSS into them as well. I need to go back and refresh myself on the basics of HTML and CSS and work my way back into JavaScript just so I can get the hang of it again. Also, take this time to plan out what projects I want to work on since I am sort of just looking around and doing random stuff.</p>

<h1>Day 3</h1>
<p>Today was the third day of 100 days of code for me. I went backwards and started the basics all over again. I am currently using freeCodeCamp to go through the basics of JavaScript. I think this is the right choice since I don't feel a certain way or I don't feel lost either in going back to learn about JavaScript. </p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>There's this quote by Richard Bach, an American author, who once said, "We teach best what we most need to learn." I think this is very true becuase when I am writing notes down and I feel lost, I either teach my dog what I learned in my one hour session and feel like I grasp what is being taught better. So I'm going to try and keep it short with what I've learned as to not overdo it on a github readme file. </p>
<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>When declaring a variable in JavaScript, you use the keyword 'let' and then the variable name. Variables can include letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores. Variables <b>cannot contain spaces or begin with numbers.</b> When you assign a variable a value at the moment of declaration, it's called <b>initialization.</b> When you declare a variable without initializing it, it's considered <b>uninitialized.</b></p>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>Personally, things got a little confusing to me when it came to arrays becuase of the different methods they were telling me to use, but these are the ones I got so far. But first, an array is a non-primitive data type that can hold a series of values and are 'detonated'(they used this word, not me) using square brackets.
  
```javascript
  let array = [];
```

When an array is holding values or elements, the values are separated by commas. <b>The order of values in an array is important.</b>

  ```javascript
  let array = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
  ```

  You can access the values inside an array by using the index of the value.<b>Index</b> is a number representing the position of the value in the array, where 0 represents the first value. 
  
  ```javascript
  array[0];
  ```
