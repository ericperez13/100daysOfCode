# 100daysOfCode
taking on the 100 days of code challenge

<h1>Day 1</h1>
<p>Today was the first day I decided to take on the 100 days of code and I am a little confused to be honest. I followed a step by step guide from MDN web docs on a number guessing game. I don't really feel like I created it myself, I feel like a fraud who just copy and posted whatever they said to copy and paste. Here is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash">link</a> if you're interested. </p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>I think some key takeaways for today is that I need to look for a different approach, or maybe take this approach and run with it. I feel fradulent almost writing the code and putting it up, but I need to remember that it's okay. I need to follow these tutorials and also take notes, keep track of what I am learning. I kind of skipped around and just copy and pasted becuase I was getting angry with myself for not being able to just do the code instead of reading the why's and how's of the documentation.</p>
